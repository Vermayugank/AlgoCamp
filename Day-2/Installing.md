### What is Git:

- Git is a tool used by developers to keep track of changes made to their code over time.

- It's like a digital notebook that lets you make notes on each change you make, including what you changed, why you changed it, and when you made the change.

- Git allows multiple people to work on the same codebase at the same time, and it helps prevent conflicts when two people make changes to the same part of the code.

- Git also makes it easy to revert back to previous versions of your code if something goes wrong or if you want to undo a change.

- Git works by creating a "repository" that stores all of the versions of your code, along with information about who made each change and when.

- To use Git, you'll need to install it on your computer and use a "command line interface" to interact with it (don't worry if you don't know what that means yet - it's just a way of typing in commands to the computer).
